//! Multi-party freshness gate for the SUR Solana agent-to-agent dark pool.
//!
//! In SUR's `a2a_darkpool`, agent A posts an `Intent` (a price band) and agent B
//! posts a `Response` (a price); they negotiate and `accept_and_settle` clears
//! the trade. Each agent's quoted price is the output of reasoning over
//! **context** — the market/price state it observed. Proof-of-context gates the
//! settlement so a negotiated trade clears **only if every party's quote was
//! made against fresh context**. This is the multi-party generalization of the
//! crate's single-commitment [`crate::settle::SettlementGate`].
//!
//! Seconds-native: the dark pool runs on unix seconds (`Clock::unix_timestamp`),
//! so freshness here is measured in seconds against the parties' anchor wall
//! clocks ([`crate::anchor::TripleAnchor::tee_drand_consistent`] for the
//! `consistent` check — TEE↔Drand only, since a Solana anchor's block is not a
//! Base block) and a seconds-based price-as-of ([`crate::price_freshness`]).
//! The block-denominated [`crate::oracle::CanonicalStateOracle`] path is untouched.
//!
//! `f_c` is not enforced (crate-wide, see the gate). `f_m` (agent model/policy
//! version) is **deferred** for quotes — agent policy versioning is not yet a
//! SUR on-chain concept; it can be composed later via an
//! [`crate::oracle::CanonicalStateOracle`] keyed on the disclosed
//! `weights_hash`.
